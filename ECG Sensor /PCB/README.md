Similar to the other sensors the ECG is a 70 mm x 70 mm board. This board was developed using EAGLE. The design is very simple. It has a slot that perfectly fits a Sparkfun ECG Pre-amplifier board. Pinholes are added to the walls of the board for easier wiring. This board also has an led as an indication of proper connection.
