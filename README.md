# Modular-Biomedical-Sensor-Board-for-Education
Modular Biomedical Sensor Board for Education, designed for the Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) of the University of Arizona (UofA). The device (currently) can take the following physiological measurements:

--> Body Fat and Water Composition  --> [Skin Impedance Sensor](https://github.com/grender007/Modular-Biomedical-Sensor-Board-for-Education/tree/main/Skin%20Impedance%20Sensor)

--> Temperature                     --> [Temperature Sensor](https://github.com/grender007/Modular-Biomedical-Sensor-Board-for-Education/tree/main/Temperature%20Sensor)

--> Electrocardiogram               --> [ECG Sensor](https://github.com/grender007/Modular-Biomedical-Sensor-Board-for-Education/tree/main/ECG%20Sensor%20)

--> Oxigenation and Pulse           --> [Pulse Ox Sensor](https://github.com/grender007/Modular-Biomedical-Sensor-Board-for-Education/tree/main/Pulse%20Ox%20Sensor)

--> Heartbeat sounds                --> [Digital Stethoscope Sensor](https://github.com/grender007/Modular-Biomedical-Sensor-Board-for-Education/tree/main/Sound%20Sensor)
