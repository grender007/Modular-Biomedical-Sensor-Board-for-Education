# Modular-Biomedical-Sensor-Board-for-Education
Modular Biomedical Sensor Board for Education, designed for the Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) of the University of Arizona (UofA). The device (currently) can take the following physiological measurements: 
--> Body Fat and Water Composition  --> Skin Impedance Sensor
--> Temperature                     --> Temperature Sensor
--> Electrocardiogram               --> ECG Sensor
--> Oxigenation and Pulse           --> Pulse Ox Sensor
--> Heartbeat sounds                --> Digital Stethoscope Sensor
