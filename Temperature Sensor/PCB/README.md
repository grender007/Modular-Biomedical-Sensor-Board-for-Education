This is a description for PCB.

The temperature PCB is the simplest PCB of this project. It opperates using a simple wheatstone bridge, a parallel circuit composed of two branches, each with two resistors on each branch. One resistor is a thermistor, a resistor whose resistance changes with the temperature, serving as the probe for the project. As the temperature and thus resistance of the probe changes, the reading between the resistors of both branches will change. This difference in voltage is measured by the ESP32 and is used to calculate the temperature of the thermistor.



The PCB is also outfitted with a Red LED, allowing the User to see when the PCB has power.
